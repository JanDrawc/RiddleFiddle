			ABOUT:

Riddle Fiddle is a riddle game written in batch when my boss
wasn't looking. Retail if fascinating. 


Open "Riddle Fiddle.bat" to play.

		     GAME RULES:

It randomizes questions every game and asks you 5 of them.

You start with 3 lives and lose a life every time you answer 
is wrong. If you get the correct answer on the first try you
gain a life.

If you lose all your lives its game over.

At the end you get a score assigned based on how many lives 
you have left and how many attempts have you taken at questions.
You also get bonus points if you answer every question at first
attempt.

Finally your score gets saved for the leader board.
___________________________________________________________
		 ADD MORE QUESTIONS:
Feel free to add more questions to the game, the more the better.

This is how to do it:

The questions are saved in the "q" folder.

They have to be named "(n).txt" where n is the number of question.
They have to be numbered in order.

In the .txt of every question the first line is saved as the 
correct answer (beware of spaces and capitals here)

Lines 2,3 and 4 are printed as the question. If your question does
not take up 3 lines, put a "_" or "." on the empty lines
or it will be printed as  " ECHO is OFF"
